    "# Final Project: Chatbot for Milk Tea Orders\n",
    "# Objective:\n",
    "This project is to design a chatbot for automatic response to customers regarding their orders at Tapioca Express boba shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chatbot is able to provide greetings, tell customers about store informations, help customers complete orders and provide a total amount spent on this order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chatbot relies on a outer \"Milk Tea Menu\" file and assumes that customers can see the menu and order on your phone. Once the customers type in the drink number, the system will print out the drink name and its price.\n"
